4. Now, the product name and consent screen need to be set -> click ‘Configure consent screen’ and follow the instructions. Once finished:
    a. Select ‘Application type’ to be 'Other'.
    b. Enter an appropriate name.
    c. Input http://localhost:8080/ for ‘Authorized redirect URIs’.
    d. Click ‘Save’.
5. Click ‘Download JSON’ on the right side of Client ID to download client_secret_<really long ID>.json.
The downloaded file has all authentication information of your application. Rename the file to “client_secrets.json” and place it in your working directory.
